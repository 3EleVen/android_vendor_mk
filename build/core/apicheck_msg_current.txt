******************************
You have tried to change the API from what has been previously approved.

To make these errors go away, you have two choices:
   1) You can add "@hide" javadoc comments to the methods, etc. listed in the
      errors above.

   2) You can update current.txt (locally) by executing the following command:
         make update-mk-api
         make update-mk-prebuilts-latest-public-api

      To submit the revised current.txt to the main MoKee Open Source repository,
      you will need approval.
